            Ingredients
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2kg leg of lamb</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, halved</li>
            <li>2 tbsp fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>Salt & black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Intructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Weber BBQ for indirect cooking over medium heat (190°C to 230°C). Using a Weber BBQ, set up your Weber BBQ with a convection tray and trivet.</li>
            <li>Using a sharp knife, cut 10 to 12 small slits into the flesh of the lamb. Push a piece of garlic and a small sprig of rosemary into each slit.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>To estimate the cooking time, measure the meat through its thickest part and cook for 1 minute per millimetre for medium. For example if the roast is 90mm thick, cook for 90 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roast the lamb over indirect medium heat for 1 ¼ to 1 ½ hours, with the lid closed, or until cooked to your liking.</li>
            <li>Once the roast lamb has cooked, remove from the Weber BBQ and leave to rest for 15 minutes before carving.</li>
        </ol>
