# The Odin Project Part 1 - Basic Recipe website

This project is to design a basic recipe website that will have a content page that links to several recipe webpages.

Skills that I should obtain by the completion of the project:

1. HTML.
2. Basic CSS.
3. Git Basics and workflow. 


Readme will be updated at the completion of the project to reflect what I have learnt.
